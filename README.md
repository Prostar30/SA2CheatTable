SA2 Cheat Table
===============

This is a cheat table for the PC version of Sonic Adventure 2 that allows for many different types of hacks.
It makes extensive use of Cheat Engine's Lua scripting engine to enable advanced hacks (like spawning items).

Miscellaneous Tips
------------------

+ If you want to spawn an object in the air (like a balloon or a GUN Beetle robot), try spawning a movable cylinder, throwing it, and replacing it while it's in the air.
+ Double-click an object name in the spawning window to see help for its parameters. (only works with some objects)
+ Double-click on a level name in the Level Mixer dialog to freeze the level value. Then start any level and it will load that one instead.
