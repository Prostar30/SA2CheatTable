This is a generic switch, found in many levels.

Spawned switches will not work if spawned on top of
the player; therefore you must spawn switches by
replacing an existing object (such as a movable cylinder)
or duplicating a switch using the keyboard controls.

X Scale = switch behavior

0 - toggle on/off
1 - momentary push (left over from SA1; kind of weird in SA2)
2 - timer switch (Z Scale controls delay, 30 units = 1 second)
3 - push once, stays on

Y Scale = switch ID
